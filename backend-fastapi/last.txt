I have a FastAPI application that's 95% migrated from Node.js/Express. I need to fix the remaining RateLimit dependency issues in 4 router files: tickets.py, shifts.py, sales.py, and reports.py. The pattern is: 1) Remove 'RateLimit' from imports, 2) Change 'Depends(CurrentUser)' to just 'CurrentUser', 3) Remove ': None = Depends(RateLimit)' lines. Can you help me apply this same pattern to these 4 remaining files?
