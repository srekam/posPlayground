## 🚀 What's New in API v15

### Core Media Storage System

**🏗️ S3/MinIO Integration**
- Direct client-to-storage uploads using presigned URLs
- Automatic bucket creation and management
- Tenant-isolated storage paths for security
- Support for both public and signed access

**🖼️ Image Processing Pipeline**
- Automatic generation of 4 image variants:
  - `thumb`: 150x150px - for grids and thumbnails
  - `sm`: 300x300px - for small cards and previews  
  - `md`: 600x600px - for product pages and medium displays
  - `lg`: 1200x1200px - for large displays and high-res viewing
- WebP format conversion for optimal compression (25-35% smaller files)
- EXIF data stripping for privacy and security
- Dominant color extraction for UI theming

**⚡ Background Processing**
- Redis-powered async image processing
- Failed asset cleanup and retry mechanisms
- Processing status tracking and error reporting
- Queue management for high-volume scenarios

### 🔒 Security & Validation

**🛡️ File Security**
- MIME type validation using magic bytes (not just file extensions)
- Configurable file size limits (default: 10MB)
- SHA256-based deduplication to prevent storage waste
- Access control levels (public vs signed URLs)

**🔐 Upload Security**
- Presigned URLs with time-limited access
- Server-side validation before finalizing uploads
- Tenant isolation at the storage level
- No direct file uploads through the API server
