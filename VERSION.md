### Version 1.15.1 - Media Storage Foundation

This version represents a major milestone in the PlayPark POS system with the implementation of a comprehensive media storage backbone.

#### üéØ What's New in API v15

**Core Media Storage System:**
- S3/MinIO-based object storage integration
- Presigned URL upload system for direct client-to-storage uploads
- Automatic image variant generation (thumbnail, small, medium, large)
- WebP format conversion for optimal performance
- CDN integration for fast global delivery

**Security & Validation:**
- MIME type validation using magic bytes
- File size limits and security checks
- SHA256-based deduplication
- EXIF data stripping for privacy
- Tenant-isolated storage paths

**Background Processing:**
- Async image processing with Redis queue
- Failed asset cleanup and retry mechanisms
- Processing status tracking
- Error handling and recovery

**API Endpoints (8 new endpoints):**
- `POST /api/v1/media/uploads/presign` - Generate secure upload URLs
- `POST /api/v1/media/complete` - Finalize uploads and trigger processing
- `GET /api/v1/media` - List and filter media assets
- `GET /api/v1/media/{asset_id}` - Get specific asset details
- `DELETE /api/v1/media/{asset_id}` - Delete assets and cleanup storage
- `GET /api/v1/media/products/{id}/images` - Get product images
- `POST /api/v1/media/products/{id}/images/order` - Reorder product images
- `POST /api/v1/media/products/{id}/images/primary` - Set primary image

**Infrastructure:**
- Docker Compose setup with MinIO, Redis, MongoDB
- Automated setup scripts and health checks
- Comprehensive documentation and examples
- Test suite for API validation

#### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Impact

This implementation establishes the media storage backbone that will support:
- Product image galleries
- Category images
- Receipt templates
- Brand assets
- User profile pictures
- Any future media requirements

#### üìä Technical Specifications

**Storage Layout:**
```
bucket: media
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tenants/<tenant_id>/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ products/<product_id>/<asset_id>/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ orig.jpg
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lg.webp
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ md.webp
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sm.webp
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ thumb.webp
```

**Performance Features:**
- WebP variants for 25-35% smaller file sizes
- CDN-friendly URLs with proper caching headers
- Lazy loading support with multiple sizes
- Background processing to avoid blocking uploads

**Security Features:**
- Presigned URLs for secure uploads
- Server-side MIME validation
- File size and type restrictions
- Tenant isolation at storage level
- Access control (public/signed URLs)

#### üîÑ Migration Path

This version is backward compatible and can be deployed alongside existing functionality. The media system is designed to be:
- Non-breaking for existing APIs
- Gradually adoptable by client applications
- Extensible for future media types

#### üìà Performance Metrics

Expected improvements with this implementation:
- **Upload Speed**: 3-5x faster (direct to S3 vs API server)
- **Storage Costs**: 40-60% reduction (WebP + deduplication)
- **Load Times**: 50-70% faster (CDN + optimized variants)
- **Scalability**: Unlimited (S3 auto-scaling)

#### üéØ Next Steps

With the media backbone in place, future versions can focus on:
- Advanced image editing features
- Video support
- Document management
- Analytics and usage tracking
- AI-powered image optimization
